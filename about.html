                    <p>William is a <span class="highlightcomp2">versatile and creative artist</span> who, through his compositional works, blurs boundaries between various musical approaches. Known for having a calm and quick-thinking mind and ability for efficient problem-solving in high pressure concert, studio or production contexts.He efficiently manages to confuse everyone who didn't know a drummer could write music or conduct an orchestra. His past experience as composer & performer for multiple bands & organizations, along with personal life experiences
                     (such as <span class="highlightcomp2">crossing south-east Asia alone on a 200$ motorcycle</span>), have given him solid composure & an aptitude of quick & efficient problem solving which has recently led him to roles tied to direction & production. Most notably, as musical director with AUTS theatre’s 2017 production of <i>Heathers: The Musical</i>, the Player’s Theatre Drama Festival, Phoenix Musical’s <i>Legally Blonde: The Musical</i> and a bilingual adaptation of the off-broadway show <i>Next Thing You Know</i>.<br><br>
                    As a <span class="highlightcomp2">composer</span> for theatre, he is mostly known for his work on <i>Brunch: The Musical</i>, for which he composed and arranged the music while directing and producing the studio sessions & cast album. The show received praised by critics and audience alike, and received generous support by both the CALQ and SOCAN.Taking his experience in contemporary music and his interest for musical theatre, he more recently composed <i>The Roswell Incident</i>, a one act electroacoustic opera about aliens, musique concrete and intergalactic justice. 
                    Having delved into synthesizers to create a surround sound “set-design” for his opera, he now joins his experience in acoustic music to a panoply of synthesizers, from the DX7’s Fm synthesis to more modern modular eurorack systems. He most notably used this sound crossover in his recent collaboration with Director Sofa Reidbord for her online series “Montreal’s Table”.
                    <br><br> William completed his B.Mus at McGill University where he focused on Composition and Jazz Drums. He studied and worked primarly with grammy-nominated drummer and composer John Hollenbeck, who influenced him in crossing musical and artistic boundaries. He now pursues the Graduate Musical Theatre Writing MFA at New York University's Tisch School Of The Arts as a composer.
